# Sharpening my Machine Learning knowledge day by day
This repo will contain all of the things that I will learn during my MLxDaysChallenge with x starting by 30 and increasing by 30 days as I go on.

## Day 1
- I began the [tutorial](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/01/build-your-first-machine-learning-pipeline-using-scikit-learn/?utm_source=feedburner) about Machine Learning pipeline using BigMart Sales dataset from Analytics Vidhya.
- I stopped at Model Building.
**ToC:** 
1. Understanding Problem Statement
2. Building a prototype model
    1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
        1. Impute the missing values
        2. Encode the categorical variables
        3. Normalize/Scale the data if required
    2. Model Building
    3. Identifying features to predict the target
3. Designing the ML Pipeline using the best model
4. Predict the target on the unseen data.
  
## Day 2
- I finished the remaining parts of the Pipeline tutorial and submitted the results to get an idea about the model performance.
- I learned from this lesson that it's best to do a thorough analysis and towards the end, after building and choosing your model, you can cleverly define your pipeline.

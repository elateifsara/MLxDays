        "We call this simple hold-out split, as we simply “hold out” the last 2.000 samples (Chollet, 2017).\n",
        "\n",
        "It can be a highly effective approach. What’s more, it’s also very inexpensive in terms of the computational power you need. However, it’s also a very naïve approach, as you’ll have to keep these edge cases in mind all the time (Chollet, 2017):\n",
        "\n",
        "Data representativeness: all datasets, which are essentially samples, must represent the patterns in the population as much as possible. This becomes especially important when you generate samples from a sample (i.e., from your full dataset). For example, if the first part of your dataset has pictures of ice cream, while the latter one only represents espressos, trouble is guaranteed when you generate the split as displayed above. Random shuffling may help you solve these issues.\n",
        "The arrow of time: if you have a time series dataset, your dataset is likely ordered chronologically. If you’d shuffle randomly, and then perform simple hold-out validation, you’d effectively “[predict] the future given the past” (Chollet, 2017). Such temporal leaks don’t benefit model performance.\n",
        "Data redundancy: if some samples appear more than once, a simple hold-out split with random shuffling may introduce redundancy between training and testing datasets. That is, identical samples belong to both datasets. This is problematic too, as data used for training thus leaks into the dataset for testing implicitly.\n",
        "Now, as we can see, while a simple hold-out split based approach can be effective and will be efficient in terms of computational resources, it also requires you to monitor for these edge cases continuously."

        "A more expensive and less naïve approach would be to perform K-fold Cross Validation. Here, you set some value for 𝐾 and the dataset is split into 𝐾 partitions of equal size. 𝐾–1 are used for training, while one is used for testing. This process is repeated 𝐾 times, with a different partition used for testing each time.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, this would be the scenario for our dataset with 𝐾=5 (i.e., once again the 80/20 split, but then 5 times!).\n",
        "\n",
        "For each split, the same model is trained, and performance is displayed per fold. For evaluation purposes, you can obviously also average it across all folds. While this produces better estimates, K-fold Cross Validation also increases training cost: in the 𝐾=5 scenario above, the model must be trained for 5 times.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s now extend our viewpoint with a few variations of K-fold Cross Validation 🙂\n",
        "\n",
        "If you have no computational limitations whatsoever, you might wish to try a special case of K-fold Cross Validation, called Leave One Out Cross Validation (or LOOCV, Khandelwal 2019). LOOCV means 𝐾=𝑁, where 𝑁 is the number of samples in your dataset. As the number of models trained is maximized, the precision of the model performance average is maximized too, but so is the cost of training due to the sheer amount of models that must be trained.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you have a binary classification problem, you might also wish to take a look at Stratified Cross Validation (Khandelwal, 2019). It extends K-fold Cross Validation by ensuring an equal distribution of the target classes over the splits. This ensures that your classification problem is balanced. It doesn’t work for multiclass classification due to the way that samples are distributed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, if you have a time series dataset, you might wish to use Time-series Cross Validation (Khandelwal, 2019). [Check here how it works](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/k-fold-and-other-cross-validation-techniques-6c03a2563f1e#4a74)."
